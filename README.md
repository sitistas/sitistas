### Hello!  👋

If you are bored to read, just go to my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/sitistas)

- 🌍 I am living in Patras, Greece
- 🏫 I am currently studying Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Patras.
- 🔭 I am a Beta Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador. Really proud to be part of this great community! Check out my [Student Ambassador profile!](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/en-US/studentambassadors/profile/1546d3ac-4ed8-4977-a7d5-aca571a2486f)
- 🌱 Exploring the potential of Azure and cloud technologies.
- 💻 Also trying to sharpen my programming skills, I am mainly working with Python, C, SQL, and Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, etc.)
- Three cool projects that I have created as part of university courses are the following:
   - [Art Gallery app](https://github.com/sitistas/art-gallery-ECE_CK703-team18) for the Databases Course of my studies. Based on SQLite & Python.
   - [Web Publisher website](https://github.com/sitistas/ECE_CK802-team_18) for the course of Web Programming. Created using HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, Node.Js & some frameworks. It is currently deployed on Heroku and you can take a look at the final result [here!](https://web-project-team18.herokuapp.com/)
   - [Bus Information app](https://github.com/sitistas/bus_arrivals_application) for the course of Advanced Programming Techniques. What is cool about this is the workflows that I've created with my partner and not the end result, but it was nice to work with CI/CD.
