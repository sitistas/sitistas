### Hello!  👋
- 🌍 I am living in Patras, Greece
- 🏫 I am currently studying Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Patras and I em expecting to graduate until the end of 2023

- 💻 Also trying to sharpen my programming skills, I am mainly working with Python, C, SQL, and Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, etc.)
- Two cool projects that I have created as part of university courses are the following:

It is currently deployed on Heroku and you can take a look at the final result [here!](https://web-project-team18.herokuapp.com/)
